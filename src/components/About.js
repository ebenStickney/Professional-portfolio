<p>
 I am a developer with an enthusiasm for and proficiency with
 building applications with React.  I can help with any project,
 whether it is a simple single page application, or something
 much larger in need of separate state containment.  I will
 test it thoroughly, make it easy to scale, and design it so
 that the UI is seamless and elegant.  To make that possible
 I have worked hard to master ES6, CSS/SASS, noSQL with Firebase
 , and version control with Git.
<br />
<br />
I am eager to be part of any project where I can put my skills to the test.  So, feel free to contact me with any questions, concerns or desire for references.
